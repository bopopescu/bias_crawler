That's what Material Design is about. Today we combine it with Bootstrap - most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first websites and apps. Bootstrap makes web development way faster and easier regardless of skill levels, devices and projects.    \r\n\r\nOur framework includes CSS for handling Animations, Colors, Typography, Helpers, Hover effects, Shadows, Icons, Components, and JavaScript. Additionally, it offers Badges, Buttons, Social buttons, Cards, Footer, Forms, Material box, Nabbers, Pagination, Panels, Parallax, Progress bar, Tables, Galleries and JavaScript.  \r\n\r\n#Demo:\r\n**Main demo**: https://mdbootstrap.com/material-design-for-bootstrap/\r\n\r\n#How to install:\r\nYou can install MDBootstrap using NPM or Bower:\r\n- `npm install mdbootstrap`\r\n- `bower install MDBootstrap`\r\n\r\n#Getting started:\r\n\r\n**5min Quick Start**: https://mdbootstrap.com/mdb-quick-start/\r\n\r\n#MDBootstrap on CDNJS:\r\n`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdbootstrap/4.3.0/css/mdb.min.css\" />`\r\n\r\n`<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdbootstrap/4.3.0/js/mdb.min.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\n#Additional tutorials:\r\n\r\n**MDB - Bootstrap tutorial**: https://mdbootstrap.com/bootstrap-tutorial/\r\n\r\n**MDB - Wordpress tutorial**: https://mdbootstrap.com/wordpress-tutorial/\r\n\r\n#PRO version:\r\n\r\n**Material Design for Bootstrap PRO (from $49)**: https://mdbootstrap.com/product/material-design-for-bootstrap-pro/  \r\n\r\n#Documentation:\r\n\r\n**Huge, detailed documentation avilable online on**: https://mdbootstrap.com/\r\n\r\n#Highlights:  \r\n**Components**  \r\nChoose **among 400+  predefined components**.
